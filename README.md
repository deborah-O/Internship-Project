# Internship-Project

This project simple bank run ABM was created during my two week internship with Improbable. It simulates two main characteristics of agents, their patience, belief and rate of perception. There is some work still to be done, but the code performs adequately at illustrating how a bank run transpires if agents are flooded with bad news (i.e. fake news). Before building this ABM, I managed to compile some research done on Information-based Bank Runs, this document should also be available.
