# Internship-Project


**Aim:**
To explore both the sources and dynamics of Bank Runs

**Objectives:**
- Investigate current literature on Bank Runs
- Use literature to build framework for Bank Run ABM

Over the few weeks at Improbable, I used the people and resources to build the foundation of my furture research on Financial Crisis. One of the three main branches of Finacial Crisis I want to explore are: Consumer-level crisis, Bank-level crisis and Governmental crisis. This internship project has formed the basis of how I aim to explore Bank-level crisis through investigating Bank Fragility. 

During the first week I compiled most of the literature regarding *Information-based* Bank Runs, as we (Improbable and I) are keen to explore information asymmetry or information externailites as the source of bank runs. I managed to write up alot of the key ideas and have made them available [here](https://github.com/deborah-O/Internship-Project/blob/master/Bank_Run_Literature_Review.pdf) also. The literature review is a very rough draft containing simplistic explanations of some key ideas, there is still alot more work to be done. I did not explore "Capital Controls" in this review, infact, I made it a point not to focus on it here, as Capital Controls (i.e. Deposit contracts and insurance) is also a verg big topic and could be explored on its own at a later date.

During my second week, I used the literature to build a basic ABM that explores important agent characteristics suchas patience, belief and perception. The next step is to add a cyclical function, where banks could return to "equilibrium" (i.e. period of recovery) and then add other agent characteristics, such as risk adversity and age. I have been considering exploring the role of social networks (see Kiss, Rodrigues-Lara and Rosa-Garcia (2014) in Literature Review) on Agent's behaviour also. 

Other things to note about the ABM are: we're assuming there is 100% transparency, meaning all decisions and information are fully disclosed truthfully, and Banks are not yet sending out mixed signals. A further development would be to add some noise into our model and reduce the degree of transparency in our model to simulate real world behaviours.
